# Luna QML

This plasmoid displays the current phase of the moon.

If you click on it, a dialog appears which shows the dates of the important moon 
phases in the same month (last new moon, first quarter, full moon, third quarter
and next new moon).

The format in which these dates are shown can be customized.

You can navigate to previous or future moon phases by clicking the arrow buttons or by 
pressing the arrow keys. Clicking the middle button or pressing the "Home" key 
returns to the current dates.

This is a port to Plasma 5 of:
